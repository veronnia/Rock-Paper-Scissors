# Rock Paper Scissors â€” Play Against Ziggy!

## Overview

This is a fun and interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game where you play against **Ziggy**, the computer. The first player to reach **5 points** wins the game!

The project was built as part of a web development learning journey to apply **JavaScript fundamentals**, **DOM manipulation**, and **Flexbox layout**, along with core **HTML** and **CSS** concepts.

## How It Works

- You choose **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** by clicking a button.
- Ziggy (the PC) makes a random choice.
- A round is played, and the winner is shown.
- Scores are updated on-screen.
- The first to reach **5 points** is declared the winner, with a reset option to play again.
